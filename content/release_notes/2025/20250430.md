#### API
For better security, in the improved API authentication system, the return object will no longer implicitly include the users' API key. The users will still be able to request their API keys by explicitly requesting for it through `SoftLayer_User_Customer_ApiAuthentication::getObject` or `SoftLayer_User_Customer::getApiAuthenticationKeys`. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause. 

Customers can avoid any disruption by proactively changing any API authentication where API key from returned object is utilized. This must be completed prior to 30 Apr, 2025. After this date, you may not be able to receive the API key from return object - you can get it by explicitly requesting for the key as described above.
