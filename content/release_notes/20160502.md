#### Portal
+ Changed functionality to automatically use Windows public stock image templates for Virtual Guest provisions/reloads that do not specify an image template. 

#### API
+ Deprecated [SoftLayer_Network_Component::getPortStatistics](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Component/getPortStatistics) as of May 4th, 2016. The call will be removed completely in the v3.2 release of the API. 

#### Backend
+ Resolved an issue that was causing billing items to not be cancelled when cancelling VMware licenses.
+ Fixed a bug where Branded Agent accounts could be created without a corresponding support policy, and adds a policy to each brand that was affected by this bug. User accounts created under these brands were unable to log in, since the login process would fail when obtaining the policy to show to the user.
