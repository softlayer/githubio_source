title: "SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Registration_Details"
description: "The subnet registration details type has been deprecated. 

The SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Registration_Details objects are used to relate [SoftLayer_Account_Regional_Registry_Detail](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Account_Regional_Registry_Detail) objects to a [SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Registration](/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Registration) object. This allows for easy reuse of registration details. It is important to note that only one detail object per type may be associated to a registration object. "
