description: "Set the password for a user who has an outstanding password request. A user with an outstanding password request will have an unused and unexpired password key.  The password key is part of the url provided to the user in the email sent to the user with information on how to set their password.  The email was generated by the SoftLayer_User_Customer::initiatePortalPasswordRequest request. Password recovery keys are valid for 24 hours after they're generated. 

If the user has required authentication methods as specified by in the SoftLayer_Container_User_Customer_PasswordSet container returned from the SoftLayer_User_Customer::getRequirementsForPasswordSet request, then additional requests must be made to processPasswordSetRequest to authenticate the user before changing the password.  First, if the user has security questions set on their profile, they will be required to answer one of their questions correctly. Next, if the user has Verisign or Google Authentication on their account, they must authenticate according to the two-factor provider.  All of this authentication is done using the SoftLayer_Container_User_Customer_PasswordSet container. 

User portal passwords must match the following restrictions. Portal passwords must... 
* ...be over eight characters long.
* ...be under twenty characters long.
* ...contain at least one uppercase letter
* ...contain at least one lowercase letter
* ...contain at least one number
* ...contain one of the special characters _ - | @ . , ? / ! ~ # $ % ^ & * ( ) { } [ ] \ + =
* ...not match your username"
