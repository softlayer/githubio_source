description: "The subnet registration service has been deprecated. 

Subnet registration objects are used to request and track registration of the subnet with the appropriate Regional Internet Registry (RIR). Registration for public subnets can be requested any time after assignment of the subnet. 

Subnet Registration objects can be updated any time after they are created. This will result in the information being submitted to the RIR and the records on their end being refreshed. "
