## Description
This certification is used to indicate the date, time and validity of the benchmark certification process. The certification process includes running a battery of tests on all major sub-systems of a server in order to verify that all components of the server are functioning up to specification. Only after a server has passed each and every hardware and configuration test will it be provisioned for a customer.
