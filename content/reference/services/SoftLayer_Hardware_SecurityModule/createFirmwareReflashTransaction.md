description: "You can launch firmware reflash by selecting from your server list. It will bring your server offline for approximately 60 minutes while the flashes are in progress. 

In the event of a hardware failure during this our datacenter engineers will be notified of the problem automatically. They will then replace any failed components to bring your server back online, and will be contacting you to ensure that impact on your server is minimal. "
